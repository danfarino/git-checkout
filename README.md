This extension lets you right-click on a file or directory and then check out that file or directory from another git commit.

## Requirements

Runs on Windows only (that is, it's only been tested on Windows so far).

## Notes

Logo was generated by opening a SVG in Inkscape and choosing "File | Export PNG Image..."
